* A: We are defining the rules for recognizing lexemes and having these lexemes/token being identified in a special way. In lexicalanalyzer.java, there is a class called lexicalanalyzer and inside there, there are static variables, character classes, token codes, operators, comparing vars, and regular symbols all being either an int or char type. These lexeme/tokens range from letters (a-zA-Z), digits(0-9),  regular symbols ($,&,@) arithetic symbols (-,+,=,*,), opening and closing brackets/parentheses([],{}), etc.

* B: We are defining a context free grammar that can handle our problem set.
