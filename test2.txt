#START

    II wallet = 14#
    II book = 12#
    II candy = 1#
    II chips = 3# 

    during (wallet > chips){
        wallet - chips#
    }   

    condition (wallet >= 1){
        wallet - candy#
    }

#END


in this program we have wallet and 3 items that cost money.
while wallet  is  greater than chip, we will subtract the price of chips
from the wallet. at the end we will check the if statement, if there is money
still in the wallet (wallet  >= 1), we will subtract  candy from wallet
