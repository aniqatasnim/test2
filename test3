in this program we have int variables by the name of different fruits,
as well as random other int variables called num and val. in this program
we are checking a condition (if statement) and checking if the "price" of
orange  + lemon is greater or equal to strawberries. if it is, we  reassign
orange to orange + strawberries.

// line 4 is missing # to end the statement 
// line 5: we named our variable before assigning the type (wrong order)
// line 6: "hi" is not an II (int) value and missing # at the end 
// line 11: variable val is never defined or declared 
// line 14: the end of program is supposed to be #END
