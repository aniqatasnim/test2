#START

    II lemon = 314#  --->  int lemon = 314; 
    II orange = 1104#   --->  int orange = 1104;
    II strawberries = 1102# --->  int strawberries = 1102; 
    II blueberries = 304# ---> int blueberries = 304; 

    II  num = 7# --> int num = 7;
    II  val = 8# int val = 8;

    condition (orange + lemon <= strawberries) {   // if statement 
        orange = orange +  strawberries#
    }

#END

in this program we have int variables by the name of different fruits,
as well as random other int variables called num and val. in this program
we are checking a condition (if statement) and checking if the "price" of
orange  + lemon is greater or equal to strawberries. if it is, we  reassign
orange to orange + strawberries.
